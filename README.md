# nice-meeting
Just a little software for having a nice meeting

# Why?
I have a lot of meetings. Humans are generally pretty great, and they often have really wonderful, nourishing, productive, encouraging, important discussions. This is an attempt to support that positive capacity and to avoid some of the common pitfalls of meetings which lead to frustration, impatience, anger and burnout.

Caveat: The vast majority of the problems with bad meetings are social and not technical, so making software is a really bad solution space to explore, but I'm going to try anyway =) Codifying social rules in software is only one technique for influencing behaviour, there are many others.

# What?
(This may change over time)

In my estimation, some of the best meetings share these qualities:
- The time and place are understood in advance
- The agenda is widely circulated and collaboratively sourced
- input from every attendee is sought before and during the meeting
- things start and end on time
- records are kept and circulated

So, I want to build software that:
- provides a quick / easy way to initially schedule a meeting
  - Once a meeting is scheduled, it has an agenda page open for collaborative editing by attendees
  - Easily access calendar entries / produce automated reminders a set time before the meeting
- During the meeting
  - Easily and collaboratively create minutes from a skeleton provided by the agenda
  - Monitor time based on planned allocations from the Agenda / default to equal time for each agenda item
  - Manage a speaking list
  - Take consensus based votes
  - Include remote attendees audio by phone or browser
    - take votes / raised hands by phone
    - Comments from browsers
    - Control muting / unmuting individually or en masse

# Can I...?
- ...run this software?
  - Sure, if you can figure out how. I'm not currently providing any support for others trying to run this software
- ...contribute to this project?
  - Probably not. Right now I'm interested in building things based entirely on my own mental model. If you happen to perfectly synthesise my mental model and make a PR I love, I'll merge it, but I'll be ignoring most suggestions / changes for now. This may change later if I feel I have a solid foundation to build on top of.
- ...run a meeting using your system?
  - Maybe. Initially, I'll only be using this system for meetings I personally attend. Later, people I personally know, and trust not to burn up my phone credit.
